Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

Output: [4, -1, 2, 1]

Explanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest sum in the input array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] is [4, -1, 2, 1], and the sum is 6.



If the input were [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]:

Output: [5]

Explanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest sum in the input array [1, -2, 3, -4, 5] is [5], and the sum is 5.
